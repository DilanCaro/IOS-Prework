## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The following are 3 applications that I like with some of their features. 

# 1. Instagram :
  - I love the boomerang option when using the camera on the app
  - I love the the upload feature for images, it is always extremely fast . It is ready to be uploaded after I finish uploading the caption.
  - I really like the option of general messages and other messages on the creator account.

# 2. CHATGPT:
  - Quick access to any information in the format I want .
  -  Love the voice/conversationm option, it does feel as if I'm talking to a person, it does need improvement in the robotic voice but still amazing
  -  I love the image generation features .

# 3. Chess
  - Love the online chess with random people matching
  - Love the offline option when on the airplane
  - The engines to play against the computer are amazing
  - The teaching materials are unmatched to any other app 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Xcode needed to update, and download everytime I opened the app. Some of the connection inspector, or edit options are very hidden and confusion at the start. 

My simulator was not working , and would crash , but it seemed it was because things were not installed correctly from the start. After a restart and reinstall , it worked.
