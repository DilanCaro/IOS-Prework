## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The following are 3 applications that I like with some of their features. 

# 1. Instagram :
  - I love the boomerang option when using the camera on the app
  - I love the the upload feature for images, it is always extremely fast . It is ready to be uploaded after I finish uploading the caption.
  - I really like the option of general messages and other messages on the creator account.

# 2. CHATGPT:
  - Quick access to any information in the format I want .
  -  Love the voice/conversationm option, it does feel as if I'm talking to a person, it does need improvement in the robotic voice but still amazing
  -  I love the image generation features .

# 3. Chess
  - Love the online chess with random people matching
  - Love the offline option when on the airplane
  - The engines to play against the computer are amazing
  - The teaching materials are unmatched to any other app

# App Idea

I would like to create an workout app, that allows to easily input workout times, weights used , has a timer and a section that suggest how to do progressive overload . 
It would be great if it also had a section of workout videos, exercises to do , and even better if it had an animation of a body with muscle groups that you click and pops up different exercises for it . 
A wiki section as well for anything related to fitness , research papers on different techniques and so on. This can be accompanied by a AI section to ask about exercise tips to the AI. 
Also, it should have analytics from previous workouts and options to export to csv files in case user wants to analyze it somewhere else. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Xcode needed to update, and download everytime I opened the app. Some of the connection inspector, or edit options are very hidden and confusion at the start. 

My simulator was not working , and would crash , but it seemed it was because things were not installed correctly from the start. After a restart and reinstall , it worked.
